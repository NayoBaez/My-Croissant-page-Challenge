        back to the Austrian city of Vienna, otherwise known as the birthplace
        of croissants. The ancestor to the modern-day croissant was called the
        kipferl, which dates back to the 13th century and comes in various
        shapes and sizes. Marie Antoinette is the one who popularized the
        croissant in France by requesting the royal bakers to replicate her

        Austrian artillery officer that founded a Viennese Bakery in Paris in
        around 1839. Do you love this story as much as we do?
